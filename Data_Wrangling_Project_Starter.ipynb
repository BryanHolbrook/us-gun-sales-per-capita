    "To answer our question, our research paper will explore two datasets, the US Census Bureau's ACS Public Use Microdata and the FBI's NICS National Instant Criminal Background Check System. For our ACS Public Use Microdata we will focus specifically on population numbers and gender in the US from 2023 to 2013. To estimate gun purchase numbers per state we will be combining our population numbers from the ACS Microdata Estimates with the NICS data set which is commonly used in estimating yearly gun purchases within the united states to complete our analysis. Both data sets contain corresponding variables allowing us to combine our data sets and estimate gun purchases in relationship to population numbers."
